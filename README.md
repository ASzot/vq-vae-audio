# VQ-VAE for Audio
Implementation of VQ-VAE for audio as described the DeepMind's paper
[here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00937).

There exists several implementations of VQ-VAE using PixelCNN as the
encoder/decoder.

- https://github.com/hiwonjoon/tf-vqvae

The goal in this repo is to have WaveNet as the encoder/decoder.
